# Pulse
Pulse is a state management library for reactive Javascript frameworks with support for VueJS, React and React Native.

Created by @jamiepine and @f3ltron

Pulse is similar to Redux in function, but styled more like VueX. Our goal is to create a structure that is lightweight, modular and powerful, but most importantly, easy to understand.
