**Global state and logic for reactive JavaScript applications.** Plug-and-play directly into your UI framework.

### Read the docs at [pulsejs.org](https://pulsejs.org).

```ts
const App = new Pulse();

const hello = App.State('the sound of music');
```

## Why Pulse?

Pulse Framework provides a complete toolset to build front-end applications quickly and efficiently. It encourages you to construct a single core library that can be used in any UI framework. The core handles everything at the center of your application â€” state management, API requests, and all miscellaneous logic and calculations. Pulse supplies computed data to your UI components with full reactivity, in the framework of your choice.

### TypeScript

Pulse is fully written in TypeScript and supports it heavily. Everything is type-safe out of the box and encourages you to write clean, typed code.
