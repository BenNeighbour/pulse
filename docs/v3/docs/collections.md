# `App.Collection()`

Pulse provides "collections" as a way to easily save data. Collections are designed for data following the same structure or "model". Such as posts, comments, reviews, store items- for example.

**Think of a collection like a database table.** Each collection comes with database-like methods to manipulate data. Data is "collected" which is a fancy way to say cached. The beauty of collections is that data can only be collected once, meaning if you need to modify it, there's one place to do so, and everything using that data will update accordingly.
